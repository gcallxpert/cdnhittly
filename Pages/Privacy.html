<p>Hittly (“Hittly”, “we”, or “us”) recognizes the importance of privacy. We want you to feel confident using our services, and this privacy policy (“Policy”) is to help you understand and describe how we collect, use, and disclose information that we obtain about users of our websites, services, plug-ins, software or other Downloadable Tools (all of which we refer to as the “Platform”).</p>
<p>Throughout this document, we will use a few terms to describe various roles. Hittly Members have signed up to use our service and created an account. Hittly Users are people who are answering surveys created by Hittly Member and have not registered and created an account with us.</p>

<h2 class="ptl pbs">Information You Provide</h2>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li>
<p>
<strong>Survey / Response Information.</strong>
When a Hittly User comes to Hittly to answer a survey created by a Hittly Member, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, email address and phone number; email addresses of other people; feedback information; and any other information you provide us or as required by the Hittly Member you are answering the survey for.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Account Information.</strong>
When you register for an account, we collect your username, email address and password. We also collect your name if you supply it in the account management section</li>

</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="ptl pbs">Information Collected Automatically</h2>
<p>Like many websites, we and our service providers use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information when you interact with us through your computer or mobile device. Using these technologies helps us customize your experience with our Services, improve your experience, and make tailor marketing messages. Here are some of the types of information we collect:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li>
<strong>Log &amp; Device data.</strong>
When you use Hittly, our servers automatically record information (“log data”), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Website. This log data may include your web address you came from or are going to, your device model, operating system, browser type, unique device identifier, IP address, mobile network carrier, and time zone or location. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="ptl pbs">Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</h2>
<ul class="bulleted">
<li>
<strong>Cookie data.</strong>
Depending on how you’re accessing our products, we may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Hittly account or your browser) or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to keep you logged in to Hittly. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Hittly account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not. To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Hittly if your computer supports such capabilities.
